### The Team

## Task Description
This is the **Task 1 of the Lab1** of the course [ID2223 Scalable Machine Learning and Deep Learning](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/ID2223?l=en).

The task consists of an **machine learning pipeline** created to predict the flower type of a given iris flower, given some specific characteristics of its sepals and petals. 

More than the code itself, it is possible to predict your own iris flower type and look at the performances thanks to **two User Interfaces** created with Gradio tools and then deployed on HuggingFace:
- ðŸª» [*Iris flower type online prediction*](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SebastianoMeneghin/iris)
- ðŸ“Š [*Iris prediction monitor*](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SebastianoMeneghin/iris_monitoring)
